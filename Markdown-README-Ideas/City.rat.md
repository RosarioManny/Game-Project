# City Rat

## Chapter 1

**You are a fellow rat of Nyc.** Ragged and tattered up. Your fur is almost black from the pipe you ran through today. You scrounge for food and lap any source of liquid no matter what the color.
You overhere a conversation of people at the deli. You run by to best cover a rat achieve, the garbage piles on the sidewalk .
Closer to the humans, you can here they have bought food at this restaurant. Humans, they are loud and shaken, especially at night. These in particular are not so fond of the food they have just purchased and wish to eat somewhere else. They talk about throwing their leftover food out and heading to someplace better.

- Do you scare them? Dropping the food but risking your injury.
- Wait and follow them. They said they will throw out the food eventually.
- Keep searching for food elsewhere. It is nyc, garbage is everywhere and plenty of people throw-out food.
