## About the game

The game is a simple storytelling game set in the universe of Harry Potter. You read the story and make decision based on what you would do.

When making decisions you will have an "inventory" called Decisions. This will allow you to look back at what you did and make decisions based on that.

The game has three endings. A good ending, bad ending and a neutral ending. While the game only has three chapters there are 27 ways you can get to an ending with only 3 ways leading you to the good.
