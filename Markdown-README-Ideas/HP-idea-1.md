Chapter M1: The Discovery

It was a cold, misty morning at Hogwarts, and the air was filled with the distant chatter of students preparing for class. In the shadowy depths of the Forbidden Forest, you discovered something unusual. While on a Herbology assignment to gather rare plants, you stumbled upon an ancient-looking pendant, half-buried in the soil, glowing faintly.

The pendant's design was unlike anything you'd ever seen. Intricate runes carved into its surface pulsed with a soft, eerie light. You could feel its power resonate through your fingertips as you picked it up. Immediately, the weight of the pendant felt far more significant than just a trinket.

You know you have to make a decision.

Option 1: Get a Friend.
You decide to tell your best friend about the pendant. Maybe together you can figure out what it is.

Something this strange and powerful shouldn’t be shared lightly. You’ll keep it hidden until you understand more.

Option 3: Go to a Professor.
This could be dangerous. It's best to show it to a trusted professor, someone with the knowledge to help you.
