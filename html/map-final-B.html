            After reading the book, you put off doing the ritual only for its whispers, to call you back few days later. 
            The pendants power are too strong to ignore and urges you to act. You go to the Forbidden Forrest and perform 
            the ritual. The pendant's magic overwhelms you and in your attempt to unlock its power without proper preparation, something goes terribly wrong. 
            Whether itâ€™s your body, unable to control its immense power or the improper structure of the ritual, all thoughts are futile.

                    The magic feels like its ripping you from the inside out. Your skin burns, torse inflates and your visions slowly turns black 
                    as if the world is flooding with ink. Time seems to be slow, as if this has been happening for 1000 years.
                    Through arcane implosion you die a terrible death.
