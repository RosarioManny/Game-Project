            You’ve kept the pendant a secret, knowing that knowledge is power, but you need to learn more about it. 
            Professor Curio, a respected teacher of relics and crystals, has an extensive collection of artifacts and research papers. 
            While you could ask her, doing so would reveal the existence of this powerful relic.
            <div>
                So one evening, when Professor Curio is away, you sneak into her office, filled with magical artifacts and ancient scrolls. 
                You think to have spotted a book that could potetntionly reference ancient artifacts.
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Great! This book might help me unlock the pendant’s power.” You overhear McGonagall and Professor Snape in the hallway.
                    Snape says, “I need to check Professor Curio's office soon; she wants me to send an owl with her research papers.
                    I'll do that after helping a student nearby…”

                The two then leave. You must act quick, what do you do with the book in your hands?
