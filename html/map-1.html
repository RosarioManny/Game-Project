                The cheerful echoes of McGonagall, literally ringing in the air as she amplifies her voice to greet the return of students. 
                You walk on by and look for your friends. Once united with your friends, Herm and Rona, you head on up to your dorms and situate yourselves. As your third year at Hogwarts, you find this 
                to be like home. Knowing where the dorms you head on up and check your new junior dorms. While looking around you see a glisten in the corner of your eyes.
                You stumbled upon a hidden pendant in the dusty corners under bureau within the common room. 
                Its surface was adorned with mysterious runes that glowed faintly, casting an enchanting light in the dim space. 
                Attached to it was a note that read, "To unlock the pendantâ€™s power, a path of courage, wisdom, or mischief must be chosen."
                I felt a rush of excitement and uncertainty; the pendant seemed to hum with potential, as if it could lead me to incredible adventures. 
                With a deep breath, I realized that the journey ahead would hinge on the choices I made, and I was ready to embrace whatever magic lay in store.
