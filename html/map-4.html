            After extensive research, youâ€™ve discovered that the pendant isn't at its full potential. It's the key to the Chamber of Origin. 
            It is said that this ancient cave lies within the Forbidden Forrest & holds the pendant's remaining magical power. 
            You have an inquiry of where this chamber may be and tell everyone...

                Everyone around fills with excitement and relief. Yet professor's tell you not to go there, especially alone and allow them to handle it later. 
                Yet your friends, Rona and Herm, run to their rooms yelling "We'll be back, we're going to get our wands and then we can go together!".
